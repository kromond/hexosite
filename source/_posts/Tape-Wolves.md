This piece was recorded at the Newtown Festival on the street in front of the Death Ray Record store.  Two songs from the Tape Wolves: "Blackcat" followed by "Batshake"

The audio is recorded on a 4 channel diy mic in a planar arrangement and mixed to FOA for youtube.  This was my first attempt at publishing something with ambisonics.  This should be audible on a modern chrome browser, or on a late model phone.  Seeing and hearing this on a headset is pretty cool, a lot of energy comes through.  The camera was also diy, 4 Xiaomi Yi cameras with custom lenses in custom housing
