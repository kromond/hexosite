This piece was recorded at the Newtown Festival on the street in front of the Death Ray Record store.  Here you see the last two songs of their set: "Blackcat" followed by "Batshake"

The audio is recorded on my 4 channel diy mic in a planar arrangement and mixed to FOA for youtube.  This was my first attempt at publishing something with ambisonics.  This should be audible on a modern chrome browser, or on a modern phoneds
