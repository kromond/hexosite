This project is a real time gallery simulation for the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.  The first version shown here includes 4 figurative sculptures specifically created for this piece, a room filling portrait sculpture installation and 9 large scale photographs.

The viewer is able to move around the art works in 'room scale' and are able to teleport to other locations.

More about this project can be found here, including download link to the working prototype for Vive or Rift
