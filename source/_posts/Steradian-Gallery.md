A real time gallery simulation for the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.  The first version shown here includes 4 figurative sculptures specifically created for this piece, a room-filling self portrait and 9 large scale photographs.

The viewer is able to move around the art works in 'room scale' and are able to teleport to other locations.
