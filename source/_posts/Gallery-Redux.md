I took some time to revisit the 'virtual' gallery project.  I added rooms, tested some ideas that have been knocking around for a while and investigated what real time raytracing might bring to the experience.  

I refactore the VR experience into a 2d walk through style and did a virtual 'walking' tour you can see in the link below.
